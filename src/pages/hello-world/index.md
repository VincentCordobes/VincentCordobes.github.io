title: Hello World

spoiler: This is a test blog post

In this personal blog I intend to write about what I learn and stuff I'm interested in.
For this purpose, I'd like to have codeblock:

```ocaml
let hello_world =
  printf "hello world"
```

_Here is some italic text_
But also nice tables, for instance to show algorithm complexity


| Algorithm  | Average             | Worst          |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Quicksort  | $\Theta(n \log{n})$ | $O(n^2)$       |
| Mergesort  | $\Theta(n \log{n})$ | $O(n \log{n})$ |
| Bubblesort | $\Theta(n^2)$       | $O(n^2)$      |

Of course items are very important too. Here are the languages I'm interested in. pay attention to the margin between items, it has been thought carefully:

- OCaml has awesome feature and it's french
- javascript becomes better and better for the web
- Rust is modern and looks so awesome too

Last but not least quote that I might not use so often but still, it's always something nice to have in our toolbox :D

Oh, I almost forgot about Math inline equation: $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $

$$
\alpha = \dfrac{|C'S|}{|CS|} \;\;\; \beta = \dfrac{|CC'|}{|CS|}
$$
