What’s the input? What’s the action to perform? What’s the expected output or observable changes in my system? If we think about it, those are exactly the three parts of a test. So starting by writing a test might help. I initially did not want to use the term ‘testing’ but you’ve guessed it so I won’t beat around the bush.</p>\n<p>In this post I am going to talk about TDD—Test Driven Development—as it’s one of the way I often use to approch a task, problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-red-green-factor\"><a href=\"#-red-green-factor\" aria-label=\" red green factor permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>🚦 Red-Green factor</h3>\n<p>First let me quote the three rules of TDD defined by Uncle Bob:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those rules may look a bit <em>strict</em> and following them may not be natural at first. But let me tell you: <strong>it’s a discipline!</strong></p>\n<p>I realized it the day I was pair-programming with my mate. There was that new feature, not very complex, we decided to write it in TDD. Let’s say it is calculating a median.</p>\n<p><em>We first need sort the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">n</span></span></span></span> items, if I have an odd number of items then we take the middle one otherwise we take the mean of the two middle values. Easy peasy!</em> I thought.</p>\n<p>The algorithm in mind and the keyboard on hand, I was ready to code.\nI jumped right into the implementation when my friend said, “Wait… what are you doing?” </p>\n<p>“Hmm I am writing the code for the new feature…” I said, proud of me.</p>\n<p>“We should start by writing a failing test” he was looking at me smiling, “Delete that code you just wrote.” </p>\n<p>Indeed, there was no ‘red’ test… Yet that’s actually the first step of TDD.  And each time I wanted to code the whole feature in one go—without the goal of making a failing test pass—my friend was there to remind me not to do so.</p>\n<p>The ‘ritual’ is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write a failing test </li>\n<li>Make that test pass </li>\n<li>Make it clean, refactor your code while keeping the tests green </li>\n</ul>\n<p>↺ Repeat!</p>\n<p>The red-green transition is very important. It means the code we’ve just written is responsible of making the test pass. The test is hooked correctly! When the code breaks, so do the test. That’s also exactly the purpose of a <strong>good test</strong>.</p>\n<p>So remember one thing: <strong>all begin with a red test</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-the-fun\"><a href=\"#-the-fun\" aria-label=\" the fun permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>🎯 The Fun</h3>\n<p>It’s such a satisfaction seeing a test going from red to green. You can’t imagine! Almost as much as seeing a whole feature completed.\nExcept that to feel the joy, we don’t need to wait for 1 day… 1 month or whatever. Baby step!</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/test_pass-9fdf8ebba9c9e4951a9ce6de091f9cb1.gif\"><figcaption>Making the test pass is rewarding</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Ever being asked to write test ‘later’?\nFirst, how can you be sure what you’ll do ‘later’ will actually tests your code ? The implementation is working anyway\nSecondly it’s not fun! </p>\n<p>When that ‘later’ comes, you’re feeling desperate because… it’s not fun!!\nWhere is the satisfaction of writting something “just because” without any other purpose. </p>\n<p>The code is working anyway.  So what might happen is that the test might not fail when the code is actually broken. Or the test will fail whenever you refactor your code without whanging its behaviour. In this case, that test is not usefull and it will even slow down your development  processs. Touching the code becomes a pain. So not only it’s useless but they are harming. Those tests are bad.\nI’ve noticed it’s a lot easier to write bad test afterward.\nDoing TDD makes programming more fun to me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A way to approach a problem","date":"January 31, 2019","spoiler":"Gonna talk about tdd","thumbnail":null},"fields":{"slug":"/tdd/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/tdd/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/git-rebase/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Demystify git rebase with animations","draft":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fp-basics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Basics of Functional Programming","draft":true}}}}
