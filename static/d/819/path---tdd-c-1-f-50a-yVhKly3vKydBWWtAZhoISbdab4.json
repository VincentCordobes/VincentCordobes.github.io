How do I find a solution to the given problem? How can I be sure that it‚Äôs a good solution and it actually does what we expect it to do ?</p>\n<p>Also, just like we want the essay to be splendid, our ultimate goal is to provide clean, robust, consistent solution. Easier said than done I hear, but it is our goal anyway!</p>\n<h2>üí≠ Before coding</h2>\n<p>What‚Äôs the input? What‚Äôs the action to perform? What will be the output or observable changes in my system? Those are the first questions I ask myself before coding.\nDoes it make you think of something? Well, I guess writing a test can help as those are exactly its three composites. I initially did not want to use the term ‚Äòtesting‚Äô but you‚Äôve guessed it so I won‚Äôt beat around the bush.</p>\n<p>In this post I am going to talk about TDD‚ÄîTest Driven Development‚Äîas it‚Äôs one of the way I often use to approch a task, problem.</p>\n<h2>üö¶ Red-Green factor</h2>\n<p>First let me quote the three rules of TDD defined by Uncle Bob:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</li>\n<li>You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those rules may seems a bit <em>strict</em> and following them may not be natural at first. Let me tell you: <strong>it‚Äôs a discipline!</strong></p>\n<p>I really understood it the day I was pair-programming with my mate.\nThere was a good and fun feature.</p>\n<p>We dediced to do it in TDD so that tests cases could serve as a reference to our domain experts. At the same time, it was <strong>very simple</strong>. It included calculating a median. Okay, so I thoughts - We just have to sort the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">n</span></span></span></span> items. If I have an odd number of items then we take the middle one otherwise we take the mean of the two middle values. Easy peasy! I thought. I had the keyboard on hand, ready to code and the <em>algorithm</em> in mind. So I jumped right into the implementation. But we had an agreement, doing it in TDD. And each time I wanted to code the whole feature in one go, my friend was there to remind me not to do so.</p>\n<p>I wanting to jump right into the implementation. but we ve had an agreement: we do it in tdd.\nit was a bit hard but every time the test was red and we had to make it pass is was such a satisfaction, you can‚Äôt imagine! It‚Äôs so rewarding!!\nIt also has many benefits. By doing so </p>\n<p>In other words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚ùå Write a failing test </li>\n<li>‚úÖ Make that test pass </li>\n<li>üßπ  Make it clean, refactor your code while keeping the tests green </li>\n</ul>\n<p>‚Ü∫ Repeat!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"One way to approach a problem","date":"January 31, 2019","spoiler":"Gonna talk about tdd","thumbnail":null},"fields":{"slug":"/tdd/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tdd/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/git-rebase/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rewrite the past in fewer steps with rebase","draft":null}},"next":null}}
